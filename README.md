# HW_FaceFollow_Leo

My project does a picture that can follow people's face. When people open the project, then the camera will open automaticly.
The sensor position will at the top of our left head, and the picture, which is a mustache, will always show up on our face.
No matter where people go, if they show up in the camera, they mustache will always follow.
